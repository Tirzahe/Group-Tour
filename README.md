by, Danielle Walker, Lelana 'Heaven' Villa and Tirzah Evengelista

## Description
The Group Tour App is a place where friends/family can collaborate to plan out their activities for a group vacation. They will be able to share attractions and activities and then vote and comment on them. This interactive app helps groups of friends or family decide what to do once they get to where they are going.

## User Stories
A typical user on our app is generally 20-50 years old and has some experience with social media.
#### Group Creator
- As a group creator I can create a travel group and invite members to join so that I can plan a successful trip with my friends/family
- As a group creator I can login to my travel page and see all of my groups and edit/delete groups as needed
- As a group creator I can enter in the location, time and all pertinent trip details so that everyone will know the details and we can search accordingly in the database
- As a group creator I can add activities to my group so we can eventually decide what we want to do on our trip

#### Beyond MVP
*** Do we want the ability for others to see great trip ideas that other groups have voted on?- maybe a search function for cities? - NOT MVP just keeping track of this idea
##### Group Creator
- As a group creator I can finalize our trip so we can all be on the same page as our trip approaches
##### Member
